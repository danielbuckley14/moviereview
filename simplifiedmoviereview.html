<p> The Theory of everything review "while there's life, there's hope." This is such an inspiring and elegant film. The cinematography is excellent and some of the shots are beautifully composed, such as the transition between Hawking's eye and the black hole. The score is a pure masterpiece "Cambridge 1963" is one of the best pieces of music I've heard in a long time, it really conveys the carefree joyful tone of Hawking early life which just makes his resulting diagnosis and studied devolution even more tragic. Eddie Redmayne is incredible in the main role of the character in a way most actors can't, managing to convey the wit and easy, upbeat humour Hawking's possessed while also showing the pain life causes him It's a phenomenal performance that deservedly won best actor at the Oscars. 
Felicity Jones is also excellent as Jane Hawking, and her arc might actually be the most tragic part of the film - how she stayed with him all those years, as she survived despite all odds yet finally has to come to terms with the fact that they don't love each other anymore. It's clear how much the illness affects her The rest of the cast is great especially Harry Lloyd and Charlie Cox,the story moves at a nice pace yet is easy to follow and lingers enough on the emotional beats... this is a perfect biopic on one of the most inspiring romances in history.
